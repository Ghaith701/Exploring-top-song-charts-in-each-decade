Intro

Verse 1
Sometimes I feel Ive got to
Run away Ive got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And Ive lost my light
For I toss and turn I cant sleep at night

Chorus
Once I ran to you I ran
Now Ill run from you
This tainted love youve given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and thats not nearly all
Oh tainted love
Tainted love

Verse 2
Now I know Ive got to
Run away Ive got to
Get away
You dont really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But Im sorry I dont pray that way

Chorus
Once I ran to you I ran
Now Ill run from you
This tainted love youve given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and thats not nearly all
Oh tainted love
Tainted love

Outro
Dont touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now Im gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love oh tainted love oh
Tainted love oh tainted love oh
Touch me baby tainted love
Touch me baby tainted love
Tainted love oh
Tainted love oh
Tainted loveVerse 1
Well theres a little boy waiting
At the counter of the corner shop
Hes been waiting down there waiting half the day
They never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around knocked to the ground
He gets to his feet and he says

Chorus
What about me It isnt fair
Ive have enough now I want my share
Cant you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give

Verse 2
Well theres a pretty girl serving
At the counter of the corner shop
Shes been waiting back there waiting for a dream
Her dreams walk in and out they never stop
Well shes not too proud to cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams

Chorus
What about me It isnt fair
Ive have enough now I want my share
Cant you see I wanna live
But you just take more than you give
More than you give

Bridge
Take a step back and see the little people
They might be young
But theyre the ones that make the big people big
So listen as they whisper
What about me

Verse 3
And now Im standing on the corner
All the worlds gone home
Nobodys changed nobodys been saved
And Im feeling cold and alone
I guess Im lucky I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more than Ive got

Chorus
What about me It isnt fair
Ive have enough now I want my share
Cant you see I wanna live
But you just take more
What about me It isnt fair
Ive have enough now I want my share
Cant you see I wanna live
But you just take more you just take more
You just take more than you give

Someone there tonight
Holding what was mine
Where are you now
You wonder where i am
Are you really feeling fine

Going through my life without you by my side
Youre the only thing that keeps going through my mind
And nothing that i do can take the place of you

Where are you now
Someone there tonight holding what was mine
Where are you now do you wonder where i am
Are you really feeling fine

Somewhere deep inside this part of you remains
Images of love and where are you now

Is someone there tonight holding what was mine
Where are you now
You wonder where i am i need you here tonightIntro

When every sunrise meant a sunny day oh a sunny day
But now when the morning light shines in
It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay oh where I lay
I used to thank the lord when Id wake
For life and love and the golden sky above me
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin
You see in my dreams you love me

Daybreak is a joyful time
Just listen to the songbird harmonies oh the harmonies
But I wish the dawn would never come
I wish there was silence in the trees oh the trees
If only I could stay asleep at least I could pretend youre thinkin of me
Cause night time is the one time I am happy
You see in my dreams

We climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us we are lost in time
And I dont know really what it means
All I know is that you love me in my dreams

I keep hopin one day Ill awaken and somehow shell be lying by my side
And if I wonder if the dawn is really breakin
She touches me and suddenly Im alive

And we climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us we are lost in time
And I dont know really what it means
But I know that you love me in my dreams

We climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us we are lost in time
And I dont know really what it means
All I know is that you love me in my dreams

Oho in in my dreamsIll always love you
For the rest of my days
You have won my heart and my soul
With your sweet sexy ways

You gave me hope
When I needed someone near
You bring me happiness
Every day of every year

And Ill always love you
For all that you are
You have made my life complete
Youre my lucky star
You are the one
That Id been searching for
You are my everything
Tell me who could ask for more
And Ill always love you

Honey this will never end
I need you by my side baby
Youre my lover my friend
Oh my friend
You gave my world
A thrill Ive never known

And filled my eager heart
With a love to call my own
And Ill always love you
You must know how much I do
You can count on me forever
And I will take good care
Of you

Ill always love you
Im so happy that your mine

If you wanna leave
Then why dont you say

Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China
In a little rowboat to find you
And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned
Didnt want no one to hold you
What does that mean
And you said

Youre on a roll and now you pray itll last
The road beyond was rocky
But now youre feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past

Why youre running so fast
And she said

Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say
That I loved you
Then I realized that
It was just my mind playing tricks on me

It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings
I pray to God its you
I just cant believe
That were through

He says Why am I soft in the middle now

Got a short little span of attention
And whoa my nights are so long
Wheres my wife and family
What if I die here
Wholl be my role model
Now that my role model is gone gone
He ducked back down the alley
With some rolypoly little batfaced girl
All along along
There were incidents and accidents
There were hints and allegations

A man walks down the street
Its a street in a strange world
Maybe its the third world
Maybe its his first time around
Doesnt speak the language
He holds no currency
He is a foreign man
He is surrounded by the sound the sound
Cattle in the marketplace
Scatterings and orphanages
He looks around around
He sees angels in the architecture
Spinning in infinity
He says Amen and Hallelujah

If youll be my bodyguard
I can be your long lost pal
I can call you Betty
And Betty when you call me you can call me Al

Theres so much tenderness in your loving
Tomorrow I must leave the dawn knows no reprieve
God give me strength when I am leaving
So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That well be back together someday
Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
As we move to embrace tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I cant believe this pain its driving me insane
Without your touch life will be lonely
So raise your hands to heaven and pray
That well be back together someday
Tonight I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight you calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness
Morning has come another day
I must pack my bags and say goodbyeIntro

To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine thats your way

While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

You shouldve seen by the look in my eyes baby
There was something missing
You shouldve known by the tone of my voice maybe
But you didnt listen
You played dead
But you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissing
And though I know all about those men
Still I dont remember
Cause it was us baby way before then
And were still together
And I meant every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant
That I love you forever

You were workin as a waitress in a cocktail bar

I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew Id find a much better place

I still love you
But now I think its time I live my life on my own
I guess its just what I must do

Verse 1
Off the Florida Keys
Theres a place called Kokomo

To the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Well put out to sea

Love I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go I come back to the place you are

PreChorus Peter Gabriel
All my instincts they return
And the grand faade so soon will burn
Without a noise without my pride
I reach out from the inside

Chorus Peter Gabriel
In your eyes the light the heat
In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
In your eyes to a thousand churches
In your eyes the resolution
In your eyes of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
In your eyes Oh I see the light and the heat
In your eyes the light the heat
In your eyes
Oh I wanna be that complete
In your eyes the light the heat
In your eyes
I wanna touch the light the heat I see in your eyes

Verse 2 Peter Gabriel
Love I dont like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

PreChorus Peter Gabriel
And all my instincts they return
And the grand faade so soon will burn
Without a noise without my pride
I reach out from the inside

Chorus Peter Gabriel
In your eyes your eyes your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes the light the heat
In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
To a thousand churches

In your eyes of all the fruitless searches
Oh I see the light and the heat
In your eyes

Thinking of you till it hurts
I know youre hurt too but

When today doesnt really know
Doesnt really know

Who can it be knocking at my door
Go way dont come round here no more

Make no sound tiptoe across the floor
If he hears hell knock all day

I like it here with my childhood friend
Here they come those feelings again
