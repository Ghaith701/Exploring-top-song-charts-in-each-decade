If I had to live without you

Baby you would take away everything good in my life

I hear the clock its six AM
I feel so far from where Ive been
I got my eggs I got my pancakes too
I got my maple syrup everything but you
I break the yolks and make a smiley face
I kinda like it in my brand new place
Wipe the spots up off the mirror
Dont leave my keys in the door
I never put wet towels on the floor anymore cause

Chorus
Dreams last so long
Even after youre gone
I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

Verse 2
I called my momma she was out for a walk
Consoled a cup of coffee but it didnt wanna talk
So I picked up the paper it was more bad news
More hearts being broken or people being used
Put on my coat in the pouring rain
I saw a movie and it just wasnt the same
Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad cause

Chorus
Dreams last for so long
Even after youre gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

Bridge
I go about my business Im doing fine
Besides what would I say if I had you on the line
Same old story not much to say
Hearts are broken everyday

Verse 3
I brush my teeth I put the cap back on
I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down
And then I take a deep breath and a good look around
Put on my pjs and hop into bed
Im half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself itll all be alright
I just shouldnt think anymore tonight cause

Chorus
Dreams last so long
Even after youre gone
And I know that you love me
And soon you will see
You were meant for me
And I was meant for you

She had two babies one was six months one was three
In the war of 44
Every telephone ring every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh would her son grow to know his father

Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
Its so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

Youre wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling

And his father and his father did
I want to be here now

I step off the train

And past your door
But you dont live there anymore
Its years since youve been there
Now youve disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
Youve found some better place

Chorus
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Verse 2

You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
Wed walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Verse 3

Can I confess
Ive been hanging around your old address
And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
Youre long gone
But I cant move on

I know what youre doing I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion you were so completely torn
It mustve been that yesterday was the day that I was born
Theres not much to examine theres nothing left to hide
You really cant be serious you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

Chorus
Cause I am barely breathing and I cant find the air
Dont know who Im kidding imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting a fool for another day
I dont suppose its worth the price youre worth the price the price that I would pay

Verse 2
And everyone keeps asking whats it all about
I used to be so certain and I cant figure out
What is this attraction I can only feel the pain
Theres nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change

Chorus
Cause I am barely breathing and I cant find the air
Dont know who Im kidding imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting a fool for another day
I dont suppose its worth the price youre worth the price the price that I would pay
But Im thinking it over anyway
Im thinking it over anyway

Your changing mind is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please dont come and go

Im only pretty sure that I cant take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
I want to get out of this
I wonder is there anything
Im going to miss

Chorus Stephan Jenkins
I wonder how its going to be
When you dont know me
Hows it going to be
When youre sure Im not there
Hows it going to be
When theres no one there to talk to
Between you and me
Cause I dont care
Hows it going to be
Hows it going to be

Verse 2 Stephan Jenkins
Where we used to laugh
Theres a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I cant ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in swings empty
Dont see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

Chorus Stephan Jenkins
I wonder hows it going to be
When it goes down
Hows it going to be
When youre not around
Hows it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I dont care
Hows it going to be
Hows it going to be

Bridge Stephan Jenkins
And hows it going to be
When you dont know me anymore
And hows it going to be
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion Oblivion

Outro Stephan Jenkins
Hows it going to be
When you dont know me anymore
Hows it going to be
Hows it going to beOh once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldnt escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah humor me and tell me lies

And Ill lie too and say I dont mind
And as we seek so shall we find
And when youre feeling open Ill still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround
Is it a surefire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

And shake me and my confidence
Bout a great many things
But Ive been there I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywoods calling for the movie rights
Singing Hey babe lets keep in touch
Hey baby lets keep in touch

But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if were lucky wed be unable to tell
Whats yours and mine the fishings fine
And it doesnt have to rhyme so dont you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround
Is it a surefire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Ha la la la bombardier this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there aint a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure the banner may be torn and the winds gotten colder
Perhaps Ive grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah I will drink in and always be full

Oh I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just cant shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right okay so be that way
I hope and pray that theres something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a runaround
Is it a surefire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down

Oh you
Why you wanna give me a runaround
Is it a surefire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me downVerse 1
Must have been mid afternoon
I could tell by how far the childs shadow stretched out
And he walked with a purpose in his sneakers down the street
He had many questions like children often do

Chorus
He said tell me all your thoughts on God
Tell me am I very far

Verse 2
Must have been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions like children often do

Chorus
We said tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why were who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far am I very far now

Verse 3
Its getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many crosseyed people
And ask many questions like children often do

Chorus
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I would really like to meet her
And ask her why were who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far
Am I very far now am I very far now am I very far now
Tell me all your thoughts on GodVerse 1

Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And Im crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

And Im nobody without someone like you

Yeah my heart is callin you
And nobody knows it but me

PreChorus 2

You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle its been torn all apart
A million words couldnt say just how I feel
A million years from now you know

The love that we had

Verse 1 Usher
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems

Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seem to think about is you
And how

Knowing it shouldve been you

Cause I I dont wanna go dont need to stay
But I really need to get it together

Birds were singing your praise

I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavyhearted
Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I went to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing

Chorus
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though Im far away
Ill whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

That you will hold me dear
Though Im far away
Ill whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Verse 1
Im packed and Im holding Im smiling
Shes living shes golden she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation her own motivation
She comes round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you

PreChorus
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
We give them the games we play she say

Verse 2
The sky was gold it was rose
I was taking sips up into my nose
And I wish I could get back there some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift you up until you break
It wont stop I wont come down
I keep stock with a ticktock rhythm a bump for the drop
And then I bumped up I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again then I bumped again I said

PreChorus
How do I get back there
To the place where I fell asleep inside you
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said

Chorus
I want something else
To get me through this
Semicharmed kind of life baby baby
I want something else
Im not listening when you say
Goodbye

Verse 3
I believe in the sand beneath my toes
The beach gives a feeling an earthy feeling
I believe in the faith that grows
And the four right chords can make me cry
When Im with you I feel like I could die
And that would be all right all right
And when the plane came in she said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in the city
We tripped on the urge to feel alive
But now Im struggling to survive
Those days you were wearing that velvet dress
Youre the priestess I must confess
Those little red panties they pass the test
So slide up round the belly face down on the mattress one
And you hold me
And we are broken
Still its all that I want to do just a little now
Feel myself hovering off the ground
Im scared Im not coming down
No no
And I wont run for my life
Shes got her jaws now locked down in a smile
But nothing is all right all right

Chorus
And I want something else
To get me through this life baby
I want something else
Not listening when you say
Goodbye goodbye
Goodbye goodbye

And you comb your hair and grab your coat and hat
And you walk the streets trying to remember yeah

And everything looks so complete
When youre walking out on the streets
And the wind catches your feet

Verse 2 John Mellencamp Meshell Ndegocello
All the girls walk by dressed up for each other
And the boys do the boogie woogie on the corner of the street
And the people passing by just stare with the wild wonder yeah
And the inside jukebox roars just like thunder

And everything looks so complete
When youre walking out on the street
And the wind catches your feet
And sends you flying
Crying
Oooh ooooh wee
The wild night is calling

Dont leave me in all this pain
Dont leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Chorus
Unbreak my heart

Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life

Unbreak my heart
My heart

Verse 2
Take back that sad word goodbye

Say that you love me say that you love me
Tell me you love me unbreak my heartWhen I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now Im guilt stricken
Sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a babys breath and a shoe full of rice no
I cant be held responsible
Cause she was touching her face
I wont be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
Wed never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
Wed ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
My best friend took a weeks
Vacation to forget her
His girl took a weeks worth a
Valium and slept
Now hes guilt stricken sobbing with his
Head on the floor
Think somebody now and how he never really
Wept he says
I cant be held responsible
Cause she was touching her face
I wont be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
Wed never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
Wed ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
Weve tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lacking relationships
And how were guilt stricken sobbing with our
Heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to
Slip wed say
I cant be held responsible
Cause she was touching her face
And I wont be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
Wed never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
Wed ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
For the life of me I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and
Wed never compromise
For the life of me I cannot believe
Wed ever die for these sins
We were merely freshmen
We were merely freshmen
We were only freshmenVerse 1
Goodbye Englands rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

Chorus
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along Englands greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Verse 2
Loveliness weve lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch well always carry
For our nations golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

Chorus
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along Englands greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Verse 3
Goodbye Englands rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourselves
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye Englands rose
From a country lost without your soul
Wholl miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

Chorus
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along Englands greenest hills
Your candles burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Outro
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along Englands greenest hills

Baby got back the junk in the trunk
She got a six pack or a hell of a rump
Yo

See many terms are used to relate
I love the girls with the big ol booties
Where Im from they call em Dukies
Pretty brown cheeks hangin from the jeans
Even city girls kick the country things
So if you get it got it good just dip the dug out

The demons that youre hiding from
When all your promises are gone
Im the only one

And Im the only one
Wholl drown in my desire for you
Its only fear that makes you run
The demons that youre hiding from
When all your promises are gone
Im the only one

Im the only one

Aint nobody else is gonna love youVerse 1
How do you cool your lips after a summers kiss
How do you rid the sweat after the bodys bliss
How do you turn your eyes from the romantic glare
How do you block the sound of a voice youd know anywhere

Chorus 1
Oh I really shouldve known
By the time you drove me home
By the vagueness in your eyes
Your casual goodbyes

By the chill in your embrace
The expression on your face
Told me maybe you might have
Some advice to give on how to be insensitive Insensitive insensitive

Verse 2
How do you numb your skin after the warmest touch
How do you slow your blood after the body rush
How do you free your soul after youve found a friend
How do you teach your heart its a crime to fall in love again

Chorus 2
Oh you probably wont remember me
Its probably ancient history
Im one of the chosen few
Who went ahead and fell for you

Im out of vogue Im out of touch
I fell too fast I felt too much
I thought that you might have
Some advice to give on how to be insensitive

Chorus 1
Oh I really shouldve known
By the time you drove me home

Have some advice to give on how to be insensitive

Verse 1 Jadakiss
Uh
Pat them down count the money let em see the work yeah
Thats the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die wont be the first nah
Wont be the last all we see is cash yeah
Your real story dont match what you rappin bout liar
So keep the movies in stop actin out
And I aint talking bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allahs leisure
Was a crack monster I had the hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules now they love the plastics
I aint tryna get caught up in this thugrap shit never
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask kid
You dont sweat the small things they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin back I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac Jada
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews they aint call us back
Either way I aint never evil
Why do you think the streets love me I aint never leave em
Heart stops but the words are forever breathing
You hatin cause we the best find a better reason

Verse 2 Fabolous
First thing first dont ever play yourself ever
Oh another thing I aint ever play myself never
Even when they all changed up I stayed myself its me
Did what worked for me then bossed up and paid myself
See Im showing the Piguet off gave the Rollie a day off
Still got that work I dont know about no layoffs
Team still ballin so I guess we in the playoffs swish
Team full of baddies all my bitches in a slayoff
See we be in the party wasted no part of fake shit
Nothin but love round me Cartier bracelets
I feel like Frank White walkin into Arty Clay shit
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city dont sleep I aint ever noddin off
When youre in the Benz it piss everybody off
So I aint stall I do me I aint yall
This New York nigga let em hang giant balls
Odell Beckham respect him you cant check him
Blindside hoes hit me when I dont expect em hey bighead
Then I hit em with the curve from the major league
Gotta wait your turn thats a major key

Verse 3 Fat Joe
Mami yellin Im the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane I got her so strung I dont even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe every time you see a nigga flee
Mr Officer I was only grabbin ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy I be speakin through the yayo
Bout to let the cans go woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know so
Yeah now its the Don in the Don couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin Uber cause Im franchised in Cuba

Verse 4 Busta Rhymes
The Conglomerate

Pop you in your shit brotha
Now make room for the money MOVE
If you dont make room Ill beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself Ill beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars you niggas better be grateful
Thank you so much
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas

Blah blah blah blah you sound alike my niggas
Blah blah but when I do it I finesse I got it locked my niggas

And know we love the boom bap oh yeah we do this too
Yeah fuck with the realer side oh you against us nigga
You better run and hide until Im finished nigga
Dont play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself end in a basket
Hate yourself
Cause you aint ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
You talk a lot Ive seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Dont you ever play yourself

Verse 5 Kent Jones
I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up
I see that youd rather flake out
Sellin stories on them tracks
That nobody can seem to make out
Thats why I keep a good head and shoulders
To keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers they prolly all had a line up
You worried bout your followers so hurt when I follow up
Its the ones with the most pride end up bein the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
Im just tryna raise a son like my blinds open
I know the hood well but glad I aint stuck in the streets
Im pop chartin but hood niggas got my song on repeat
Im still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
Im playin hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the Gram I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy Im talkin my moms mammy
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bench stories you aint even part of it all
Start from the bottom or oh please dont start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood I feel like Noah
Cause all he had was little rocks an ark and saw
Road to riches Im still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her
Please be hammered so you can sex us
My arm strong if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if its not immediate then dont even send a message
FYI Ill be free round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be New Orleans
Im an organ donor Im alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain
Cause bitch theres no arteries

Well I tried to tell you so Yes I did
But I guess you didnt know

Baby now I got the flow
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And show you that Id win

PreChorus
You lied to me

Dont let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

Verse 1 by Kevin Gleason
I will never forget you theres no doubt about that
Feelings still go in my mind bout my nan and my dad
How they died it still runs through my mind
Its sad to think that nothing will ever be fine
Shits got me stressed it got me depressed
Im only 15 and I feel like its the end
But I gotta realize that this isnt what they would want
They would want me to live my life to the full extent
But its still hard cause my life got bent
I always hear the freaky voices in my head
While Im laying in my bed
Saying the same shit that they wouldve said
And I got many people in my life that still love me
They all want the best of me
I think I can do it because your watching above me
I will always remember you I hope you do the same of me

Verse 2 by Kevin Gleason
I will remember you will you remember me
I feel like my success rate is in jeopardy
Everyones been begging me
To make sure me and drugs never meet
Because Ive never done it and I can see how  much it affected me
So many people have expected me
But my pops directing me
And it took me forever to see
But now I finally notice
And when Im feeling down I dont show my anger I just note it
And I record it and put it in my music
I never thought I knew it
Its so damn soothing
It began so confusing
But now its different and Im really committed
Because my family put so much effort into it
I gotta pay them back show my appreciation
They showed so much dedication
I put them in so much frustration
Now Im finally gonna give them what they been waitingfor

Verse 3 by Kevin Gleason
I will remember you will you remember me
Because all of this sadness is just too much for me
I thought I could get through with it but it was too difficult for me
I said Ill always remember you will you remember me
Because I miss you guys so much and its too much to bare with me
Its been a couple years and it aint getting any easier
My heart feels like its been destroyed by a meteor

Verse 1
This heres a jam for all the fellas
Tryin to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya overzealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But youre standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next days function high class luncheon
Food is served and youre stonecold munchin
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Just bust a move
Just bust a move
Just bust a move

Verse 2
Youre on a mission and youre wishin
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So dont hang yourself with a celibate rope
New movies showin so youre goin
Could care less about the five youre blowin
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin in your row
Shes dressed in yellow she says Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next Hey bust a move

Chorus
You want it
You got it
You want it
Baby you got it Just bust a move
You want it
You got it

Baby you got it yeah

Verse 3
In the city ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says No way
Girls are fakin goodness sakin
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic materialistic
Lookin for a man makes them opportunistic
Theyre lyin on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach youre strollin real high rollin
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin to prove
So dont just stand there bust a move

Chorus
You want it
You got it

Baby you got it Just bust a move
You want it
You got it

Verse 4
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry
In five days from now hes gonna marry
Hes hopin you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony youll be the best man
You say neato check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And theres one more girl you wont be getting
So you start thinkin then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that youre winking
She thinks youre kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin really firm cause the girl is stacked
Receptions jumpin faces pumpin
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do so you bust a move

Chorus
You want it
You got it

Baby you got it Just bust a move

Verse 1  Toumi
It comes to something when the only word that you gots a truthful one and a known liar wants to go and try and ignite a fire that they know damn well could get you straight smoked

Close friends know Im not a G and I never have been but if my time in this citys taught me one thing its that we DONT snitch and a loose tongue is one thats removed in one stroke

Now who wanna come and run up on a nigga
Now who wanna chat shit about a nigga
Now who wanna contest who got the most rapport and support in the underworld

AROO

Lone soldier know the roads older folks that grow smokes and blow the smoke over
Only roll close with blokes that roll coldest
Phone a cold blower Oh the shows over

But theres rules to a life like mine
Following them to stay safe is your best bet
Ive been reading between the lines so much
I dont even know what the text says

So I sit and Im wondering why Im hungry
Ceaseless thunderous rumbling in my tummy
I roll low key and beneath the kids sharp
B when you C me accidents leave scars

So I suggest you reassess whats more important
Pride or health
Or find yourself quickly in a situation of life or death
Internally conflicteds the only time Im beside myself
So keep it on a level you dont want your head beside your neck

Verse 2  Toumi
Unpleasant shit out the way Im here so where do I start
Id like to welcome every one of you to a week of nothing but bars
From bullshit from the top of my head to deepest issues of heart
From boppin along at a randomers gaff to taking your headphones off

Descriptive and vivid and most all of this shits explicit
Im warning you all right now that your parents probably wont get it

To be frank I dont think that you will either
Crank this shit up my bars they get deeper
Its all good vibes so chill and get wasted
Bring you shit super smooth like Craig David
Spark a convo like how was your day
No way babe Really Oh that shits cray
I dont believe it man they at it again
Ignore them hun theyre not worth your breath
I think you need to go rest your eyes
Tink that Im cute Oh youre too kind
Arent you so silly whatre you like
Im just your bog standard average guy

Bridge 2  Toumi

Wonders why he convinced himself they EVER could give a shit

Verse 3  Toumi
Bare heads think that they know me
Bare heads wish to control me
So many heads gonna lose their headback
Attempting to make a show of me

Sick of it all and Im sick of saying that Im sick of it
Pinnacle ambitions whatll keep bringin the lyrics
Follow that with a passion 4 years of practice
Badman of rap and what do you get Hazard

Been shtum for a minute yea
But fortunately I aint slacked
You want to me post more raps
Dont matter Looky here now Im back

You cant knock my confidence when half your face is Mac
I give it about five months before youre sucking a dick for more crack
Me
Different outcome Im not pissin about if the sunll still rise tomorrow the raysll still touch this house and as sure as daylightll fade in the night time Ill still be rhymin
A beacon to let you know that theres always a light ashining but its bright
And it burns
Exposurell get you hurt

To the point you go and pick up a burner and wanna murder before you step out and face the world

Ive got my individuality Im a man that reps like no other
My whole life up to now I considered myself a lover
