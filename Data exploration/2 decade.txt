Hello girl its been a while
Guess youll be glad to know
That Ive learned how to laugh and smile
Getting over you was slow
They say old lovers can be good friends
But I never thought Id really see you
Id really see you again

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy
No my heart just cant hide
That old feelin inside
Way deep down inside
Oh baby
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

You say he satisfies your mind
Tells you all of his dreams
I know how much that means to you
I realize that I was blind
Just when I thought I was over you
I see your face and it just aint true
No it just aint true

I go crazy
When I look in your eyes I still go crazy
That old flame comes alive
It starts burning inside
Way deep down inside
Oh baby
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy

Whoa whoa
I go crazy
You know when I look in your eyes I go crazy
No my heart just cant hide
That old feelin inside
Way deep down inside
I go crazyVerse 1
Why me Lord
What have I ever done
To deserve even one
Of the pleasures Ive known
Tell me Lord
What did I ever do
That was worth lovin you
Or the kindness youve shown

Chorus
Lord help me Jesus

Verse 2
Try me Lord
If you think theres a way
I can try to repay
All Ive taken from you
Maybe Lord

What Ive been through myself
On my way back to you

Chorus
Lord help me Jesus

I was working in the lab late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

Chorus
He did the mash he did the monster mash
The monster mash it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash it caught on in a flash
He did the mash he did the monster mash

Verse 2
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

Chorus
They did the mash they did the monster mash
The monster mash it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash it caught on in a flash
They did the mash they did the monster mash

Verse 3
The Zombies were having fun the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman Dracula and his son

The scene was rockin all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains backed by his baying hounds
The coffinbangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group The CryptKicker Five

Chorus
They played the mash they played the monster mash
The monster mash it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash it caught on in a flash
They played the mash they played the monster mash

Verse 4
Out from the coffin Dracs voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist

Its now the mash its now the monster mash
The monster mash it was graveyard smash
Its now the mash it caught on in a flash
Its now the mash its now the monster mash

Verse 5
Now everythings cool Dracs a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door tell them Boris sent you

Chorus
Then you can mash then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash youll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash then you can monster mash

And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

When youre perfect in every way

To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord its hard to be humble
But Im doing the best that I can
I used to have a girlfriend
But she just couldnt compete
With all of these love starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet
Well I probly could find me another
But I guess theyre all in awe of me
Who cares I never get lonesome
Cause I treasure my own company

Think of all that weve been through
And breaking up is hard to do

They say that breaking up is hard to do
Now I know I know that its true
Dont say that this is the end
Instead of breaking up I wish that we were making up again

And calls to the other guy Im Ali catch me if you can
He says Im the greatest the worlds ever seen

Little smiles so warm and tender looking up at us

Making my entrance again with my usual flair
Sure of my lines

Im stayin aliveAt first I was afraid I was petrified
Kept thinkin I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinkin how you did me wrong
And I grew strong and I learned how to get along

And so youre back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If Id have known for just one second youd be back to bother me

Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now cause youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye
Did you think Id crumble Did you think Id lay down and die

Oh no not I I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive
Ive got all my life to live and Ive got all my love to give
And Ill survive I will survive hey hey

It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just tryin hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry but now I hold my head up high

And you see me somebody new
Im not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like droppin in and just expect me to be free
Well now Im saving all my lovin for someone whos lovin me

Go on now go walk out the door
Just turn around now cause youre not welcome anymore
Werent you the one who tried to break me with goodbye
Did you think Id crumble Did you think Id lay down and die

Oh no not I I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love I know Ill stay alive
Ive got all my life to live and Ive got all my love to give
And Ill survive I will survive oh

Sad eyes turn the other wayI got up this morning
While I was having my coffee
My woman came in sat down by my side
With tears in her eyes
She said Ive a confession to make
I said Woman speak whats on your mind
She said Ive found somebody new
To take your place
I said dont feel so all alone
Ive found someone of my own
All those lonely nights
You left me all alone
My true love would call
And talk to me on the phone
I said Woman if thats the way its gotta be
Then darlin dont you worry about me
She said Ive found somebody new
To take your place
I said dont feel so all alone
Ive found someone of my own
I got up from the table
Reached down and wiped the tears
From her face
I put out my cigarette
Turned and walked away
She said Ive found somebody new
To take your place
I said dont feel so all alone
Ive found someone of my ownDarlin if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me
Darlin if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me
Darlin if you want me to love love only you then love only me
Darlin if you want me to see see only you then see only me

Theres a line I cant cross over
Its no good for me and its no good for you

And theres a feelin deep down inside me
I cant explain it and youre wondering why
You say weve been like strangers
But Im not the others you can wrap round your fingers

Darlin if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me
Darlin if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me
Darlin if you want me to love love only you then love only me
Darlin if you want me to see see only you then see only me

There was a time when I would come runnin
Id drop everything for the touch of your hand in mine

You were blind
And now you regret it
Cause I cant forget it
Its locked in my mind
And I cant go on livin

Day to day
Wondering if well be here tomorrow
People change and youre changin
And Ive given you my all
Theres no more to borrow

Darlin if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me
Darlin if you want me to be closer to you get closer to me
Darlin if you want me to love love only you then love only me
Darlin if you want me to see see only you then see only meSpoken by Winifred Lovett

I wont be able to see you anymore
Because of my obligations and the ties that you have

When you turn and walk away dont look back

Dont know whats come over you
Youve found someone new
And dont it make my brown eyes blue

Ill be fine when youre gone

And dont it make my brown eyes blue

Tell me no secrets tell me some lies
Give me no reasons give me alibis
Tell me you love me and dont let me cry
Say anything but dont say goodbye

Dont it make my brown eyes
Dont it make my brown eyes
Dont it make my brown eyes blueI cried a tear you wiped it dry
I was confused you cleared my mind
I sold my soul you bought it back for me
And held me up and gave me dignity
Somehow you needed me

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me you needed me

And I cant believe its you I cant believe its true
I needed you and you were there
And Ill never leave why should I leave Id be a fool
Cause I finally found someone who really cares

You held my hand when it was cold
When I was lost you took me home
You gave me hope when I was at the end
And turned my lies back into truth again
You even called me friend

You gave me strength to stand alone again
To face the world out on my own again
You put me high upon a pedestal
So high that I could almost see eternity
You needed me you needed me
You needed me you needed meVerse 1

Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you filled with gratitude and love

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new

You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you Ill always have a friend
Youre someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
