Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the bloods run stale

I wanna hide the truth I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside theres nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come

Its where my demons hide its where my demons hide

At the curtains call its the last of all
When the lights fade out all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you made

Dont wanna let you down but I am hellbound
Though this is all for you dont wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come

Outro Hillary Scott
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you nowVerse 1 Gotye
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and its an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But Ill admit that I was glad it was over

Chorus Gotye
But you didnt have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I dont even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didnt have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I dont need that though
Now youre just somebody that I used to know
Now youre just somebody that I used to know
Now youre just somebody that I used to know

Verse 2 Kimbra
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that Id done
But I dont wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldnt catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

Chorus Gotye
But you didnt have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I dont even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didnt have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I dont need that though
Now youre just somebody that I used to know

Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me Ill give it a chance now
Take my hand stop put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now Im singing like

And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play and Im singing like

You shine it when Im alone

Verse 2

Touch my own skin

In an unlocked place
The only time I feel safe

Verse 3 Juicy J
Shes a beast I call her Karma come back
She eat your heart out like Jeffrey Dahmer Woo
Be careful try not to lead her on
Shawtys heart is on steroids cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love when you meet her meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her keep her
Shes sweet as pie but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my sleeping beauty Im gon put her in a coma Woo
Damn I think I love her shawtys so bad Im sprung and I dont care
She ride me like a roller coaster turn the bedroom into a fair a fair
Her love is like a drug I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil mama so dope I messed around and got addicted

Chorus Katy Perry
So you wanna play with magic

Cause once youre mine once youre mine

WoohooChorus 1
Some nights I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights I call it a draw
Some nights I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights I wish theyd just fall off
But I still wake up I still see your ghost
Oh Lord Im still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for
What do I stand for
Most nights I dont know anymore

Verse 1
This is it boys this is war
What are we waiting for
Why dont we break the rules already
I was never one to believe the hype
Save that for the black and white
Try twice as hard and Im half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style

PreChorus 1
And thats alright
Thats Alright
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I who I who I am
Oh who am I

Chorus 2
Well some nights I wish that this all would end
Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights Im scared youll forget me again
Some nights I always win I always win
But I still wake up I still see your ghost
Oh Lord Im still not sure what I stand for oh
What do I stand for
What do I stand for
Most nights I dont know

When I hear songs they sound like a swan

Verse 2
Well that is it guys that is all
Five minutes in and Im bored again

All dried up in the desert sun

Verse 1
I thought that Ive been hurt before
But no ones ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life

PreChorus
Got a feeling that Im going under
But I know that Ill make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

Chorus
You watch me bleed until I cant breathe shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that Im without your kisses
Ill be needing stitches
Tripping over myself aching
Begging you to come help
And now that Im without your kisses
Ill be needing stitches

Verse 2
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh you lured me in I couldnt sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now Im gonna reap what I sow
Im left seeing red on my own

PreChorus
Got a feeling that Im going under
But I know that Ill make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on

Chorus
You watch me bleed until I cant breathe shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that Im without your kisses
Ill be needing stitches

Begging you to come help

Ill be needing stitches

I wish I found some better sounds no ones ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didnt have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now Im insecure and I care what people think

PreChorus

Verse 2
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come Im never able to identify where its coming from
Id make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it never sell out of it Id probably only sell one
Itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose
Same clothes home grown a stones throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes we all would take the latter

PreChorus
My names Blurryface and I care what you think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think

You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

PreChorus

For a minute I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

Chorus 1
I knew I loved you then
But youd never know
Cause I played it cool

But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until were grey and old
Just say you wont let go
Just say you wont let go

Verse 2
Ill wake you up with some breakfast in bed
Ill bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And Ill take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And Ill thank my lucky stars for that night

PreChorus 2
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that Im older
I wanna dance with you right now oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that everyday youll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

Chorus 2
Im so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more

Verse 3 TI
Hustle Gang Homie
One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris boo
Had a bitch but she aint bad as you
So hit me up when you pass through
Ill give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on em even when you dress casual
I mean its almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde let you pass me by
Nothin like your last guy he too square for you
He dont smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So Im just watching and waitin
For you to salute the true big pimpin
Not many women can refuse this pimping
Im a nice guy but dont get confused this pimpin
