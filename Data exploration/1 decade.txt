Me and my drumOn the bank of the river
Stood Running Bear young Indian brave
On the other side of the river
Stood his lovely Indian maid

Little White Dove was her name
Such a lovely sight to see
But their tribes fought with each other
So their love could never be

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldnt die

He couldnt swim the raging river
Cause the river was too wide
He couldnt reach Little White Dove
Waiting on the other side

In the moonlight he could see her
Throwing kisses cross the waves
Her little heart was beating faster
Waiting there for her Indian brave

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldnt die

Running Bear dove in the water
Little White Dove did the same
And they swam out to each other
Through the swirling stream they came

As their hands touched and their lips met
The raging river pulled them down
Now theyll always be together
In their happy hunting ground

Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love big as the sky
Running Bear loved Little White Dove
With a love that couldnt dieMoon river wider than a mile
Im crossing you in style some day
Oh dream maker you heart breaker
Wherever youre goin Im goin your way
Two drifters off to see the world
Theres such a lot of world to see
Were after the same rainbows end waitin round the bend
My huckleberry friend moon river and meA broken heart is why
I sing this song to you
So you and all the
World would know
Why I have let you go
They say Im robbing
The cradle little darling
Because Ive fallen
In love with you
They say Im robbing
The cradle little darling
Is it strange for
True love to be so young
Well everybody says
That youve got blue eyes
But your eyes are
Really brown like mine
Well everybody says
That youre unhappy
But with me you
Really look so fine
They say Im robbing
The cradle little darling
Because Ive fallen
In love with you
They say Im robbing
The cradle little darling
Is it strange for
True love to be so young
Well they all say
That Im outta line
Cause I want to make you mine
But what very few people know
That we planned
Everything just so
They say Im robbing
The cradle little darling
Because Ive fallen
In love with you
They say Im robbing
The cradle little darling
Is it strange for
True love to be so young
Is it strange for
True love to be so youngOh the shark babe
Has such teeth dear
And he shows them
Pearly white
Just a jackknife
Has old Macheath babe
And he keeps it
Out of sight

You know when that shark bites
With his teeth babe
Scarlet billows
Start to spread
Fancy gloves though
Wears ol Macheath babe
So theres never never a trace of red

Now on the side walk ooh Sunday morning uh huh
Lies a body just oozing life EEK
And someones sneaking round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the Knife

Theres a tugboat down by the river dont you know
Where a cement bags just a drooping on down
Oh that cement is just its there for the weight dear
Fivell get ya ten ol Mackies back in town

Now did ya hear bout Louie Miller

After drawing out all his hard earned cash
And now Macheath spends just like a sailor

Love is but a song we sing
Fears the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
And you may not know why

Try to love one another right now

When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last

Fading in the grass

Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninetytwo
With George Pratt his partner and brother Billy too
They crossed the Yukon River and found a bonanza gold
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome

Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below
He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow
With the northern lights arunnin wild in the land of the midnight sun
Yes Sam McCord was a mighty man in the year of nineteenone

Where the river is windin big nuggets theyre finding

Said Sam youre alookin at a lonely lonely man
Id trade all the gold thats buried in this land
For one small band of gold to place on sweet little Jennys hand

Cause a man needs a woman to love him all the time
Remember Sam a true love is so hard to find
Id build for my Jenny a honeymoon home
Below that old white mountain just a little southeast of Nome

Oh yeahVerse 1
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosas Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

Verse 2
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain I could tell

Verse 3
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena the girl that I loved

Verse 4
So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Verse 5
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

Verse 6
Out through the back door of Rosas I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I could from
The West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Verse 7
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everythings gone in life nothing is left
Its been so long since Ive seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

Verse 8
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothings worse than this pain in my heart

Verse 9
And at last here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosas Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena I go

Verse 10
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting I cant let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosas back door

Verse 11
Something is dreadfully wrong for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
Im getting weary unable to ride

Verse 12
But my love for Feleena is strong and I rise where Ive fallen
Though I am weary I cant stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

Verse 13
From out of nowhere Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that Ill die for
One little kiss and Feleena goodbye

And the moon was yellow
And the leaves came tumbling down

I was standing on the corner
When I heard my bulldog bark
He was barking at the two men
Who were gambling in the dark

It was Stagger Lee and Billy
Two men who gambled late
Stagger Lee threw seven
Billy swore that he threw eight

Stagger Lee told Billy
I cant let you go with that
You have won all my money
And my brand new Stetson hat

Stagger Lee started off
Goin down that railroad track
He said I cant get you Billy
But dont be here when I come back

Go on Stagger Lee

Stagger Lee went home
And he got his 44
Said Im going to the bar room
Just to pay that debt I owe

Stagger Lee went to the bar room
And he stood across the bar room door
Said Now nobody move
And he pulled his 44

Stagger Lee cried Billy
Oh please dont take my life
I got three little children
And a very sickly wife

Stagger Lee shot Billy
Oh he shot that poor boy so bad
Till the bullet came through Billy
And it broke the bartenders glass

Now look out Stagg come onI cried a tear because of you
I cried a tear because were through
I cried a tear what else could I do
But cry and sigh for love of you

I felt a tear fall in my heart
You fooled me so I wasnt smart
I cant believe that we must part
Come back to stay lets make a new start

I cried a tear because of you
I cried a tear because were through
Please make my dreams of you come true
Dont make me cry a tear for you
Dont make me cry a tear for youIn 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept acomin
There wasnt nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Onetwothree with aonetwothree

We looked down a river
Huttwo
And we seed the British come
Threefour
And there must have been a hundred ofem

Beatin on the drums
Threefour
They stepped so high
Huttwo
And they made their bugles ring

We stood beside our cotton bales
Huttwo
And didnt say a thing
Twothreefour

We fired our guns and the British kept acomin
There wasnt nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they begin to runnin

If we didnt fire our muskets
Onehut twothreefour
Till we looked em in the eye

We held our fire

Till we seed their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns
And really gave em  well we

Fired our guns and the British kept acomin

They ran so fast

That the hounds couldnt catch em

On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
Onetwo huptwothreefour

We fired our cannon til the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fired another round
We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy orbison singing for the lonely
hey thats me babe and I want you only
Dont turn me home again
I just cant face myself alone in that mirror again tonight
Dont run back inside you know just what Im here for
So youre scared and youre thinking
That maybe you we aint that young anymore
Show a little faith well woman theres magic in the night
You aint a beauty but hey baby ah youre alright
And thats alright with me

This 44 shes gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl I gotta get her back out on the street
I know youre lonely like me so baby dont try and fake it
Im no prince and I cant lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and shes pretty tough to beat
Theres plenty of room in my front seat baby if you wanna take it

Oh roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
Its like the rushing touch the dirty wings them highway angels wear
Well tonight were gonna find out how it feels
Im gonna trade in your wings  for wheels
Climb in back heavens waiting down on the tracks
Ah mama come take my hand well now try hard chrissie to understand

Oh take a chance take a chance take a chance

So leave what youve lost leave whats grown old on thunder road

Well now I bought this guitar and I learned how to make it talk

From your front porch to my front seat

Climb in back baby the rides for free
Oh come take my hand were gonna ride all the way to the promised land
Well dance all the way
Oh baby I dont know but Ive been told

If we take our chance take our chance

Now the seasons over and I feel it getting cold
I wish I could take you to some sandy beach where wed never grow old
Ah but baby you know thats just jive
But tonights bustin open and Im alive
Oh do baby whay you can to make me feel like a man
But this 442s gonna overheat
Make up your mind girl I gotta get her back out on the street
I know youre lonely like me oh so dont fake it
And maybe I cant lay the stars at your feet
But I got this old car and shes pretty tough to beat
Theres plenty of room in my front seat
Oh if you think you can make it climb in so christine climb in
This is town full of losers and baby I was born to winThis land is mine God gave this land to me
This brave and ancient land to me
And when the morning sun reveals her hills and plain
Then I see a land where children can run free
So take my hand and walk this land with me
And walk this lovely land with me
Though I am just a man when you are by my side
With the help of God I know I can be strong
Though I am just a man when you are by my side
With the help of God I know I can be strong
To make this land our home
If I must fight Ill fight to make this land our own
Until I die this land is mineLet me tell the story I can tell it all
About the mountain boy who ran illegal alcohol
His daddy made the whiskey the son he drove the load
And when his engine roared they called the highway Thunder Road
Sometimes into Ashville sometimes Memphis town
The Revenuers chased him but they couldnt run him down
Each time they thought they had him his engine would explode
Hed go by like they were standing still on Thunder Road
And there was thunder thunder over Thunder Road
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load
And there was moonshine moonshine to quench the devils thirst
The law they swore theyd get him but the devil got him first
It was on the first of April NineteenFiftyFour
The federal man sent word hed better make his run no more
He said 200 agents were covering the state
Which ever road he tried to take theyd get him sure as fate
Son his daddy told him make this run your last
The tank is filled with 100 proof youre all tunedup and gassed
Now dont take any chances if you cant get through
Id rather have you back again than all that Mountain Dew
And there was thunder thunder over Thunder Road
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load
And there was moonshine moonshine to quench the devils thirst
The law they swore theyed get him but the devil got him first
Roaring out of Harlan revving up his mill
He shot the Gap at Cumberland and streamed by Maynardville
With G men on his tail light road block up ahead
The mountain boy took roads that even angels fear to tread
Blazing right through Knoxville out on Kingston Pike
Then right outside of Bearden they made the fatal strike
He left the road at 90 thats all there is to say
The devil got the moonshine and the mountain boy that day
And there was thunder thunder over Thunder Road
Thunder was his engine and white lightening was his load
And there was moonshine moonshine to quench the devils thirst
The law they never got him cause the devil got him firstHere I stand watching the tide go out so all alone and blue just dreaming dreams of you I watched your ship as it sailed out to sea Why oh why must I go on like this Shall taking all my dreamsand taking all of me
I just be alonely stranger on the shore The sighing of waves the wailing of the wing
The tears in my eyes burn pleading 
My love returnThe loveliness of Paris seems somehow sadly gay
The glory that was Rome is of another day
Ive been terribly alone and forgotten in Manhattan
Im going home to my city by the Bay

I left my heart in San Francisco
High on a hill it calls to me
To be where little cable cars climb halfway to the stars
The morning fog may chill the air I dont care

My love waits there in San Francisco
Above the blue and windy sea
When I come home to you San Francisco
Your golden sun will shine for me
