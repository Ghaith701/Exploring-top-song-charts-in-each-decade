Verse 1
Well you done done me in you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but youre so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now Im trying to get back
Before the cool done run out

And its our Godforsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

Verse 3
Ive been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bendin over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what Im saying is there aint no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
Its what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

Chorus
But I wont hesitate no more no more
It cannot wait Im yours

So please dont please dont please dont

Cause our time is short
This oh this oh this is our fate
Im yours

Right now hes probably slow dancing
With a bleachedblond tramp
And shes probably getting frisky
Right now hes probably buying her some fruity little drink
Cause she cant shoot whiskey
Right now hes probably up behind her with a poolstick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he dont know

Chorus
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up fourwheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats

Slashed a hole in all four tires

Verse 2
Right now shes probably up singing some
Whitetrash version of Shania karaoke

Oh and he dont know

Youre my reason for reason the step in my groove

Chorus
And if you say this life aint good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood

You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart make it real or else forget about it

Verse 2
Ill tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word

Out from the barrio you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

Step one you say we need to talk
He walks you say sit down its just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

Chorus
Where did I go wrong I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Verse 2
Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things youve told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you and

Where did I go wrong I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones youve followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or hell say hes just not the same
And youll begin to wonder why you came

When dreaming Im guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
Because I dont want to leave the comfort of this place
Because theres a hunger a longing to escape
From the life I live when Im awake

Come on lets go there
Lets ask Can we stay

To a place where blind men see

Verse 2
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But my friend Id sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate

And that heaven is overrated
Tell me

One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were 
looking for yourself out there
Now that shes back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation hey hey
She checks out Mozart while she does taebo
Reminds me that theres aroom to grow hey hey yeah
Now that shes back in the atmosphere
Im afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol Jane told a story about a man 
who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
But tell me 
did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were 
looking for yourself out there
Can you imagine no love pride deepfried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know youre wrong
Can you imagine no first dance freezedried romance
Fivehour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me
But tell me 
did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way
And tell me 
did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated

did you fall from a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were 
looking for yourself

Verse 1
A hundred days have made me older

A thousand lies have made me colder

Disappear now when Im dreaming of your face

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That dont bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out

Even though goin on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend Im okay
But thats not what gets me

Its hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But Im doin It
Its hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and Im alone

I would trade give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

Chorus
I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain
Once youd gone there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

Verse 2
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king

Chorus
I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I cant explain

But that was when I ruled the world

I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield

But that was when I ruled the worldVerse 1

Im gonna make it all right but not right now
I know youre wondering when
Youre the only one who knows that
I know youre wondering when
Youre the only one who knows that
I know youre wondering whenVerse 1
I hold on so nervously to me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me
But so far has not been good its been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should

This club has got to be the most pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me
Well I am imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Hook
Well Im not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because youre standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
Youll probably move right through me on my way to you

Verse 2
I hold out for one more drink before I think
Im looking too desperately
But so far has not been fun I should just stay home
If one thing really means one

This club will hopefully be closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me
Well Im still imagining a dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Hook
Well Im not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because youre standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
Youll probably move right through me on my way to you

Well Im not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because youre standing still
If your body matches what your eyes can do
Youll probably move right through me on my way to you

Not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you
I wanna make you move because youre standing still

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

PreChorus 1
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please dont go and I said

Chorus 1
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes

Verse 2
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

PreChorus 2
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please dont go and I said

Chorus 2
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh

Bridge
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

Chorus 3
And said Marry me Juliet
Youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say yes

Outro
Oh oh
Oh oh
Because we were both young when I first saw youVerse 1
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat
But always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed

I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes
I hope one more opens
Promise me that youll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Chorus
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

Verse 2
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Living might mean taking chances
But theyre worth taking
Loving might be a mistake
But its worth making

Dont let some Hellbent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to selling out
Reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Chorus
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

Time is a wheel in constant motion
Always rolling us along
Tell me who wants to look back on their years
And wonder where those years have gone

Bridge
I hope you still feel small
When you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes

Chorus
Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

I need some shelter of my own protection baby
Be with myself and center

And big girls dont cry
Dont cry dont cry dont cry

I am unwritten cant read my mind Im undefined
Im just beginning the pens in my hand
Ending unplanned

PreChorus
Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Chorus
Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins
The rest is still unwritten
Oh oh

Verse 2
I break tradition
Sometimes my tries are outside the lines
Weve been conditioned to not make mistakes
But I cant live that way no

Let the sun illuminate the words that you cannot find
Reaching for something in the distance

Outro
The rest is still unwritten
The rest is still unwrittenVerse 1
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But thats how its gotta be
Its coming down to nothing more than apathy
Id rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and whos still standing when it clears

Chorus
And everyone knows Im in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
Shes on your mind shes on your mind

Verse 2
Lets rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But thats disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Chorus
And everyone knows Im in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
Shes on your mind
Shes on your mind
Everyone knows Im in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
Shes on your mind
Shes on on

Bridge
And suddenly Ive become a part of your past
Im becoming the part that dont last
Im losing you and its effortless
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I wont let it go down til we torch it ourselves

Chorus
And everyone knows Im in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
Shes on your mind
Shes on your mind
Everyone knows
Shes on your mind
Everyone knows Im in
Over my head
Im in over my head Im over my
Everyone knows Im in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
Shes on your mind
Shes on your mindVerse 1
Somewhere theres speaking
Its already coming in
Oh and its rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now youre here and you dont know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who wont return

Chorus
Hes everything you want
Hes everything you need
Hes everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you dont know why

Verse 2
Youre waiting for someone
To put you together
Youre waiting for someone to push you away
Theres always another wound to discover
Theres always something more you wish hed say

Chorus
Hes everything you want
Hes everything you need
Hes everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you dont know why

Bridge
But youll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
Its only what youre asking for
And youll be just fine
With all of your time
Its only what youre waiting for

Verse 3
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who wont return

Chorus
Hes everything you want
Hes everything you need
Hes everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you dont know why

Chorus 2
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I dont know why
And I dont know why
Why
I dont know
